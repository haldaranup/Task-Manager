# Task-Manager

Objective
Develop a web application that allows users to input task descriptions in natural language, and automatically extract the following structured information:

Task Name

Assignee

Due Date & Time

Priority (default is P3 if not specified)

Parsed tasks should be displayed in a structured, editable UI.

üó£Ô∏è Input Examples (Natural Language)
arduino
Copy
Edit
"Finish landing page Aman by 11pm 20th June"
"Call client Rajeev tomorrow 5pm"
"Prepare slides Anup P1 by Friday 10am"
üß† AI/Parser Expected Output
Task Name	Assigned To	Due Date/Time	Priority
Finish landing page	Aman	11:00 PM, 20 June	P3
Call client	Rajeev	5:00 PM, tomorrow	P3
Prepare slides	Anup	10:00 AM, Friday	P1

Notes for Parser Logic:

If priority is not mentioned ‚Üí default to P3

Assignee is usually a proper noun following the task name

Due date/time might be in various formats:

"tomorrow 5pm"

"20th June 11pm"

"Friday at 3pm"

Task name ends just before assignee or "by" clause

‚úÖ Functional Requirements
1. Natural Language Task Input
Input field where users type free-form tasks

Example placeholder: e.g., "Submit report Riya by 4pm Friday"

2. Task Parsing (AI or rule-based)
Extract task name, assignee, due date/time, and priority

Display parsed results in structured format

3. Display Parsed Task (UI)
Task board or list view

Columns:

Task

Assigned To

Due Date/Time

Priority

4. Inline Task Editing
Users can click and edit any field (task name, assignee, etc.)
